#### Part 1.


 1. Which software did you use to conduct your analysis?

Freiburg RNA Tools

 2. How similar were the two sequences (`s1.fasta` and `s2.fasta`) which you applied an alignment program?

They are somewhat similar throughout most of the comparison however, the software tells us that the score of these two sequences is 9 meaning that there are a lot of similarities, but also minor differences. Most of the similarities appear in the middle of the section.

 3. Are the two sequences closely related to each other, in your opinion?

They appear closely related to each other.

 4. What proof do you have to suggest such a claim?



#### Part 2
 1. How much similarity exists between each of the sequences to the others?

Each of them are in the high ninety percentile in terms of similarities with the lowest being just above ninety-five percent. Judging by that it appears as though the sequences are relatively similar.


 2. Based on your results so far (which are too few to provide a comprehensive study), do you believe there is evidence that human adaptation is occurring in H5N1 viruses that might merit concern about human-to-human transmission in the near future?

Possibly. The DNA of the influenza are relatively similar in terms of its sequences however, these small differences can make all the difference when it comes down to the influenza having an effect on humans. However, because these influenza viruses are so similar to each other, especially between the avian and the human sequence, there is still a likelihood that it could become a human-to-human transmission. The main reason for why I say this is because of COVID-19

 3. Statistics: What were the numbers of Lengths, Similarities, Gaps and Scores for each of your alignment tasks?

(chicken, human): Lengths 1776, Similarity 1690/1776 (95.2%), Gaps 45/1776 (2.5%), score 9435
(Chicken, avian): Lengths 1751, similarity 1681/1751 (96%), gaps 20/1751 (1.1%), score 9379
(avian, human): Length 1776, similarity 1731/1776 (97.5%), gaps 25/1776 (1.4%), score 9703
